# MSI2
Repository for project of Artificial Intelligence Methods 2 - the course in MiNI WUT

## Project 1 - Solving CVRP problem with Ant Colony algorithm
All documents (conspect, raport and presentation) are available in folder `project1/documents`.

### Reproduction of the results
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the folder `project1/src/AntColony`
3. Run the comend: `pip install .`
4. Open the folder `project1/src/scripts`
5. Run the commend `python solve_multiple_problem.py`

After the point 5, you should see somenthing like this:
